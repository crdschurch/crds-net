            <strong>What denomination is this?</strong><br />
            Crossroads is interdenominational. Our beliefs are shared by many different Christian denominations, and we 
            welcome everyone no matter what they believe.
          </p>

            <strong>I absolutely do not believe in God. Am I still welcome?</strong><br />
            Yes, you absolutely are welcome. We do expect that you’ll be open to exploring your questions about God and 
            wrestling with what you find. And we do expect you to believe we’re funny. Or at least fake it.

            <strong>What do I do with my kids?</strong><br />
            BRING THEM. There’s a place at Crossroads called Kids’ Club—available at most weekend services—that provides 
            a safe, fun environment where kids can figure out what God and the Bible are all about in a language they 
            understand. There are middle school and high school services at most sites for your older kids as well. Check 
            out location pages for more specific info for sites nearest you.

            <strong>Who funds this place?</strong><br />
            It’s the generosity of everyday people in our community that fuels the life change experienced around here. 
            Our support comes from the normal tithes (10 percent of gross income) and offerings of average folks who love 
            contributing to the kinds of things they see God doing in our midst.

            <strong>This doesn't look like a church.</strong><br />
            First of all, that’s not even a question. How about this: “What’s a church supposed to look like?” We think 
            a church is about the people inside, not about the building, so it shouldn’t matter if we look like a former 
            warehouse or a city school. And while you might not find steeples or stained glass around here much, there’s 
            no shortage of really authentic people and free coffee.

            <strong>What does Spiritual Outfitter&trade; mean?</strong><br />
            Following Jesus is an adventure. We believe that God has designed Crossroads to be a Spiritual Outfitter&trade; 
            that inspires, equips, and guides people who want to explore faith and go on an adventure.
