<p>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, for the cross</p>

<p>Ayyyyyyye got me running round
Got me running round
I been dodging heavy rounds
from the haters underground
And to say they never got me
I’d be lying through me teeth
But my Poppa sent a King to come to catch a body
#tbt early 2k
I wrote this on a Thursday
‘bout that time I left my mama house to Tie a knot to early
Wasn’t tryna hear the mayday from the tribe that fought to raise me
You can’t tell me nuthin<br />
I thought I was Rays kid
Every dollar to name was
thrown away for what?
Signing papers to untie a knot
they told me would blow up!
Ma told me child never come here
Life can be so unforgiving
Pride comes before a fall
Stones call for heavy lifting
Another brother in the stats
Fading like some chalk
Fell to my knees
Didn’t see the cross like Rucker park, my God
I Had nothin else to say I been Wylin
Heard a voice Could tell that He was smiling
Then He told me</p>

<p>Every step of the way
Never left ya lone
Take yo problems
Fold em
Angels roll that stone away <br />
Yeah Yeah, cause I’m the best friend you’ve ever had
I gave my life for you, so Ha, flash Forward back to today
I get it I get it my Heavenly Father been down wit me
pre pre-K
No way I could ever fall now
Because I got heavy insurance
with no money down</p>

<p>Upon the brink of calvary
Where your wounds had set us free
From death came life and life made way
When they rolled the stone away</p>

<p>Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, for the cross
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, for the cross</p>
