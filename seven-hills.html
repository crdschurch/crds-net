                <p class="font-family-base soft-top">We call them the seven hills we die on. Simply calling these
                    “values” doesn’t cut it. All too commonly, values have come to signify mushy, sentimental ideals for
                    which we rarely fight. As a church, we believe that if something is worth living for, it is worth
                    dying for. We realize we can’t do everything—but what we, as a community, are called by God to do,
                    we do with excellence</p>

                            authenticity, just being real. (From Philippians 3:17 in the Bible</p>

                        <p class="push-top">Crossroads is a place for people on every part of the spiritual journey, from those just
                            investigating whether there is a God to those who have made following Christ the priority of
                            their life. The Bible presents a dangerous message of life change. We don’t assume everyone
                            believes, or even knows the Bible, but we do assume everyone who comes through our doors is
                            open to exploring it. We believe the Bible is God’s inerrant truth and it’s the foundation
                            to everything we do. (From 2 Timothy 3:16 in the Bible)</p>

                        <p class="push-top">Crossroads is a place that helps connect those who are exploring God’s love and truth. The
                            challenge for us is that the Bible was written a long time ago for people in another
                            culture. The fact that we live in 21st century, it doesn’t change the message that God gave
                            2000 years ago, but it does mean that we need to do some work to connect it to our lives
                            today. Jesus did exactly the same thing when he was teaching. He used the current language
                            and daily life experiences of those around him to communicate truth. That’s what we mean by
                            “culturally current communication.” (From Ecclesiastes 12:10 in the Bible)</p>

                            service but never move beyond the casual, arm’s distance relationships of an auditorium. We
                            want to grow by really “doing life together.” People who grow in their relationship with God
                            also grow in their friendships with each other, moving beyond the Auditorium in small
                            groups, Community Groups and through serving. Real community is knowing and being known,
                            loving and being loved, celebrating and being celebrated, serving and being served. (From
