                We’re made in His image, which means we’re like him in many ways, except
                that he’s God and we’re not. He’s loving and just and desires a
                relationship with us. As individuals with free will, we have the freedom
                to respond to the relationship God’s initiated with us, or not.
            </p>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                We’re free to choose to live outside the realm of the life God has for
                us as it’s explained in the Bible. Put another way, many choices we make
                either move us closer to God or further away from him. Making even
                seemingly small decisions that separate us from God is called sin. We
                all do it, and we’ll continue to do so. And, even then, God will love us
                and passionately pursue us.
            </p>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                God loves us so much, in fact, that he sent his only son, Jesus, to die
                so the rest of us could live. The cost of sin was separation from
                God—spiritual death—until Jesus came and his death paid everyone’s debt.
                That’s serious love. Because of that serious, perfect love, this gift
                from God is waiting for anyone who wants to receive it. This is called
                Grace. God gives grace freely and abundantly.
            </p>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                As for us, we need only to decide whether or not to believe and receive
                this stuff. If we decide to believe it, we have available to us a new,
                full life that can start now and never stop. And it’s OK to have a lot
                of questions along the way. Although God reveals things to us (including
                what he’s revealed about himself in the Bible), he remains mysterious
                and wonderful.
