            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">They wanted a great environment to meet with friends to explore
                questions about God without having to pretend
                they had it all together or wading through a bunch of religious lingo. They wanted to offer their
                friends an
                alternative that wouldn’t make assumptions about what they believed about God or knew about the Bible.
                They
                wanted to assure their friends that no one would single them out by asking, “Where are all the
                visitors?”
            </p>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">On March 24, 1996, Crossroads Community Church of Hyde Park “went
                public” in a Cincinnati neighborhood.
                About 450 people showed up that day to a rented room, intrigued by the promise of “great music, free
                coffee
                and real topics.” In the years since, Crossroads has grown tremendously. The goal was never size; the
                goal
                always was, and continues to be, based upon the ideas of authentic community, honest conversation and
                exploring the question: Where is God taking us next?</p>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">Life and faith in God is an adventure. Crossroads is here to inspire,
                equip, and guide people through the
                technicolor heart-pumping adventure they were born for–to change the world for God. </p>
