            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                We believe that the Bible, composed of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testament, is the inspired
                word of God and without error in the original writing. The Bible was given by God through chosen people
                and thus reflects the backgrounds, styles, and vocabulary of human writers. The Bible is the full and
                final authority on all matters of faith and practice; there are no other writings similarly inspired by
                God. The Bible’s truth is timeless and speaks to our everyday lives.

            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                We believe there is only one God, Creator and Lord of everything, infinitely perfect, all powerful, all
                knowing and eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit (The Trinity).

                <strong>God The Father</strong><br>
                We believe that the Father is Creator and Ruler of all. He is compassionate, loving and just toward all
                people and is faithful to keep His promises. He hears and answers prayer. He calls all people to believe
                in Him and saves from sin and eternal death each person who comes to Him through His Son, Jesus Christ.

            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                <strong>God The Son</strong><br>
                We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He came to earth fully God and fully man through a
                miraculous conception and virgin birth. He lived a sinless life and voluntarily died on the cross in our
                place as full payment for the sins of all people. He arose bodily from the dead on the third day to
                demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended into heaven to the right hand of the Father where
                He is the only One who is able to provide access and reconciliation between God and people. He will
                return personally and visibly to earth and those who have believed in Him will be united with God
                eternally in Heaven. Those who have not believed in Him will be separated from God in Hell due to their
                sin.

                <strong>God The Holy Spirit</strong><br>
                We believe that the Holy Spirit is the Comforter, Counselor and Helper sent for believers. We believe in
                the present ministry of the Holy Spirit who reveals God’s truth to the world and indwells believers to
                empower them for Godly life and service. We believe in the diversity of gifts given by the Spirit for
                the common good of the church and that they are operating today.

            <h2 class="section-header flush-bottom">salvation</h2>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                We believe every person is disobedient to God’s desires and plans in varying degrees. Any disobedience
                to God, regardless of how large or small, is characterized as “sin.” “Sin” literally separates each
                person from God, which is spiritual death. Spiritual death is not God’s desire. People can be united
                with God through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and Him alone. Jesus died for sinners.
                Anyone who accepts, and believes in Jesus’ death for their personal sins, and desires to have Him as
                King of their life, is forgiven for every sin. Upon this personal decision, God re-establishes a
                personal relationship with that person and promises eternal life.

            <h2 class="section-header flush-bottom">church</h2>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                We believe that all those, anywhere, who acknowledge Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord make up the one
                true church. The purpose of a local church is to organize Christians to reach unbelievers with the
                message of salvation, serve as a corporate body for worship of God, provide fellowship for Christians
                with each other, develop the gifts and talents of Christians for godly service, and practice baptism and
                communion. We believe baptism and communion are God’s ordinances to be observed by believers in Jesus
                Christ, but not to be regarded as means of salvation.

            <p class="font-family-accent text-gray-light">Matthew 28:18-20; Mark 16:15-16; Acts 2:38-41, 42-47, 38-41;

            <h2 class="section-header flush-bottom">faith & practice</h2>
            <p class="font-family-base soft-top">
                Scripture is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice. This church recognizes that it
                cannot bind the conscience of individual members in areas where scripture is silent. Rather, each
                believer is to be led in these areas by the Lord, to whom he or she alone is ultimately responsible. By
                adhering to God’s Word and seeking Him, we can best observe His greatest commandments, which are to love
                Him and others.
