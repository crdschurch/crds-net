                  to get connected to a deeper relationship with Jesus. We will inspire, equip & mobilize staff and
                  volunteer leaders throughout Crossroads to more fully engage as GUIDES for others in our community.

                  It’s the last thing Jesus told us to do, and we have the Holy Spirit guiding us. It might get rocky at
                  times, but you’re also growing in the process.

                  Just because someone might be more mature, in a different life stage, or has completely different
                  experiences than you, doesn’t mean you can’t still be a good guide. Even if you simply connect,
                  listen, and pray, you’ve guided. And you have a team and resources to support you.

                  Many of your existing relationships aren’t just guides. You’re investing in them more deeply, they’re

                  needed. Not all guiding relationships go deeper, and it’s not expected for them to. But where you have
                  additional relationship to lead others, go for it.
