        <p class="lead">Two year olds learn best through play and interaction. While the children are playing, singing,
          dancing, etc., they will be learning indirectly about all sorts of new concepts. Our goal is to introduce the
          alphabet, primary colors, shapes and counting 1-10. We do this during play time, art time and during circle
          time.</p>
        <p class="font-size-base">There are many opportunities for the children to develop their fine motor skills
          (zipping, lacing, writing and cutting) as well as their large motor skills (running, jumping, and playing on
          the outdoor play set) during our day at school. We also spend lots of time on self-help skills like
          hand-washing, cleaning up toys, and picking up after themselves when snack time is over. We also focus on
          sharing, taking turns, sitting and listening, and verbalization skills. This is also a wonderful time to
          develop independence from mom and dad!</p>
