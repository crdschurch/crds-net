                                        allergies or special requirements. Students will be responsible for taking
                                        their own medication. We ask that students only bring enough medicine for the
                                        duration of camp. All medication should be brought to camp in original
                                        prescription bottles. An adult leader will MONITOR student’s taking of any
                                        medications. Monitor means that the volunteer will provide an opportunity for
                                        the student to take the medication as close to the scheduled time as possible
                                        and observe the student taking the medication, to the best of their ability.
                                        Neither the leader nor Crossroads may be held liable for the failure of the
