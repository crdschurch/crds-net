      <blockquote>As he bounced from place to place – staying in shelters, with a friend, with a cousin – Daryl grew so
        depressed he wanted to end his life. “I came close to stepping in front of a car and ending it.” But God had
        plans for him. “I have realized this place, City Gospel Mission, was a foundation.” Daryl’s life has gradually
        been restored. After a long battle with drugs and alcohol that saw him mostly absent from his three daughters’
        lives, his family is being restored, too. He was able to save enough money while staying at the shelter for a
        few months and move into a home with his daughter and grandkids. “I have something to do the right thing for. I
        can’t let them fall by the wayside.”</blockquote>
