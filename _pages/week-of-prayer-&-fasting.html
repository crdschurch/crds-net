<h2 class="component-header">CONTINUE TO PRAY</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">We’re praying for the mega themes our leadership team feels are our wildly important goals (WIGS) for the upcoming ministry year:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Attract</strong> - we want more people – the people we love – to come to know God</li>
<li><strong>Connect</strong> - we want the people we attract to build relationships in community</li>
<li><strong>Transform</strong> - we want the people who become connected to be transformed to live generous and free lives</li>
</ul><hr><h2 class="font-size-base">CONTINUE TO FAST</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">Fasting subdues our appetites and humbles us before God. Continue to fast intermittently throughout the year from the things that take your attention away from Him. <a href="https://crds-cms-uploads.imgix.net/content/images/fasting-sample.jpg">Here’s a guide to help you.</a></p>
