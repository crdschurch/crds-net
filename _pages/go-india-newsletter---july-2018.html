<p class="font-size-base">By Judge Russell<br> Thursday, August 9 at 6:30pm<br> Crossroads Oakley, Fireplace Room</p>
<hr><p class="font-size-base">Have you ever wondered how you could help an individual who has been trafficked? Become a CHANGE Court Mentor.</p>
<p class="font-size-small"><strong>Details</strong>:<br> When a trafficked person is arrested in Ohio, they now have the option of CHANGE Court - a 2 year period of intensive supervision probation. Under Judge Russell, the team helps participants overcome addiction, get counseling, find independent housing, jobs, and reconnects them to their families if they so choose. Successful participants get their criminal charges expunged, offering them a true second chance.</p>
<p class="font-size-small"><strong>Commitment</strong>: CHANGE Court mentors commit to model healthy relationships, meeting with their mentee for a minimum of one hour, twice a month for 2 years.</p>
<p class="font-size-small"><strong>Please RSVP if interested</strong> in attending the training by contacting Susie Tweddell: Phone 414-339-0783 / Email setweddell@gmail.com</p>

<h4 class="component-header">Congrats to Teri Campbell (GO Nepal Team 2017) on your Award Winning Photo!</h4>
<img data-src="//crds-cms-uploads.imgix.net/content/images/crossroads-teri-campbell.jpg" class="imgix-fluid img-responsive" alt="" title=""><p class="lead push-top"><a href="https://www.teristudios.com/" target="_blank">Teri Campbell</a> // Cincinnati, OH “Intersection”</p>
<p class="font-size-base">Cincinnati-based photographer Teri Campbell was on assignment in Kathmandu, Nepal when he shot this image. He was documenting the efforts of an NGO that provides programs and relief for sex trafficking victims. As the bus returned to the hotel after a day of shooting, Teri noticed the frenetic energy and chaos of the intersection, a microcosm of Nepal in itself. He snapped away as the bus crossed the intersection, given only a minute to capture this urban scene. <br><br><em>“To me, this photo perfectly sums up the chaos and symphony that is Nepal. I don’t know if I could have expressed that when I clicked the shutter, but I did feel a need to capture this image – and I took as many shots as I could while our vehicle danced through the intersection, even straining my neck to get one or two more frames as it disappeared behind us.”</em></p>
<p class="font-size-small"><a href="https://www.asmp.org/current-news/best-2017-contest-winner-announcement/" target="_blank">Teri’s ASMP submission</a> was awarded First Place in the Commercial category.</p>
