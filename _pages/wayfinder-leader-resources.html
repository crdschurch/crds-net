<h2 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase">And Remember...</h2>
<p class="lead">No one expects you to have everything each person needs. You won’t know many answers. You’ll go through seasons you just don’t have as much time. Stuff will surface that’s way out of your league. In those days, just connecting them to another group, person, or training that can move them to the next place is powerful. Plus, it lightens your load, expands their network and makes this whole thing healthy and sustainable. It’s good!</p>
