<p class="lead">Due to the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey, the city of Houston is working hard to rebuild. Crossroads has sent $50,000 and a group of volunteers to work with Hope Force International, but it is time for us to get even more invested in this community. God calls us to help those in need, so we will do everything we can to be a blessing. We are currently working on the logistics and feasibility of sending a group this summer to start helping this city. If you are interested in being a part of this trip, please fill out the form below so we can get you the details as they become clear. If you have questions, please email <a href="mailto:gohouston@crossroads.net">gohouston@crossroads.net</a>.</p>
