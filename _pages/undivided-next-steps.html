<p class="lead font-family-base">The Undivided™ group experience is meant to move us INTO relationships and move us OUT to be reconcilers in our city. Here are the ways we’re mobilizing as an army of Undivided reconcilers. Join us!</p>

<h4 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase" style="background-color: #e1e43f; padding: 10px; line-height: .9em;">Prison Ministry at Lebanon Correctional Institution</h4>
<p class="font-family-base font-size-small">The Four-Seven Ministries is an army investing into prison inmates, where love and grace are foreign concepts. At local prisons, we offer Crossroads Anywhere services, Undivided, The God Experiment, pre-professional programs, inmate mentoring and reentry education. Volunteers help inmates build spiritual and professional skills needed to change lives and end generational incarceration.</p>

<h4 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase" style="background-color: #e1e43f; padding: 10px; line-height: .9em;">Undivided Justice Team</h4>
<p class="font-family-base font-size-small">Some see poverty, hopelessness and bondage. God sees an opportunity to work together toward justice, mercy and healing. The Justice Team works with organizations setting a new racial trajectory in our city. Volunteers help with expanding preschool access, partnering to confront mass incarceration and striving to ensure every job in our community provides its employees a sense of dignity and the resources to care for those they love.</p>

<h4 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase" style="background-color: #e1e43f; padding: 10px; line-height: .9em;">CityLink Center</h4>
<p class="font-family-base font-size-small">CityLink is a place where people can be surrounded by one team to find the help they need to transform the trajectory of their family’s life, leading to self-sustainability and hope. Volunteers fuel this work providing care for clients through tutoring, teaching classes, hospitality, child care, car repair and more. Volunteer orientation takes place the first Thursday of every month at 6pm.</p>

<p class="font-family-base font-size-small">Change a child's life by giving your time and heart to tutor and mentor at-risk kids. From weekly to as-needed, the time commitments are as varied as the roles. Our volunteers become so much more than tutors. They become mentors, friends and positive role models that change the lives of children beyond the classroom.</p>

<h4 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase" style="background-color: #e1e43f; padding: 10px; line-height: .9em;">Foster Care</h4>
<p class="font-family-base font-size-small">One of the ways our community wrestles with issues of racial brokenness is within the child welfare system. A disproportionate number of children of color are impacted, and the bottom line is that they all need the involvement of caring, compassionate adults. Ways to be involved include fostering children, respite care, becoming a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) or joining the Safe Families ministry.</p>

<p class="font-family-base font-size-small">Crossroads will pair you with a co-leader of a different race and together, you’ll lead a racially mixed small group through a 6-week Undivided session. Facilitators attend a one-day training and receive unique guides that lead you through the entire program.</p>
