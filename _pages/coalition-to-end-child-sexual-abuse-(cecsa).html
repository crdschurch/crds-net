<p class="font-family-base-light font-size-h5 text-gray-light">about CECSA</p>
<p class="lead">Child sex abuse is one of the most horrific evils that exists in the world today and has been prevalent throughout human history. Until we all stand together as a community and become intentional about preventing child sex abuse it will remain hidden and flourish behind closed doors and in the darkest crevices of our society.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">Our culture has come a long ways in the past several decades in reducing the prevalence of child sexual abuse and lessoning the stigma that encompasses this topic. However, the statistics are still staggering and only through further discussion, openness and support will we continue to reduce the risk for our children being harmed.</p>
<ul class="font-size-base"><li class="push-quarter-ends">1 in 10 children will experience child sexual abuse before the age of 18<sup>1</sup></li>
<li class="push-quarter-ends">90% of child sexual abuse victims are abused by somebody they know<sup>1</sup></li>
<li class="push-quarter-ends">60% of victims are abused by somebody the family trusts<sup>1</sup></li>
<li class="push-quarter-ends">Youth are the victims in 66% of all sexual offenses reported to law enforcement<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul></div>
