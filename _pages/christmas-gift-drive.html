      <p class="lead">Every Christmas season, we get to give gifts to children in need&mdash;some of whom have a parent in prison, some we know through Whiz Kids and other relationships in the area. People from our Crossroads communities buy, wrap and deliver the gifts. <strong>This year, we&rsquo;re changing the name to Christmas Gift Drive</strong>.</p>
      <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Why?</strong><br /> As we grow and expand our partnerships with local organizations like Children&rsquo;s Hospital, BLOC Ministries, and others, we want to be able to bless them at Christmas, too. Angel Tree is the official name for Prison Fellowship&rsquo;s program, and can only be used for children in their program. With the name Christmas Gift Drive, we can continue to grow and bless more organizations, including Angel Tree, who we continue to support.</p>
      <p class="font-size-base"><strong>How can you help?</strong><br /> We need help giving out gift tags in the Atriums and organizing gifts in the gift storage areas at all sites before and after the the last weekend in November and first two weekends in December. We get to deliver the gifts to the kids on a Saturday morning prior to Christmas. Sound like fun? It is!</p>
