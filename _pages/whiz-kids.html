<p class="push-top"><strong>MENTORING</strong> (ALL SITES)</p>
<p>Build a relationship with an at-risk student (grades 2-12) on their turf. Time commitment is at least twice each month. Get to know their families, introduce them to your friends, go to a baseball game, bring them to Crossroads...anything that shows the child that you care, and that you are a trusted part of his or her life. Mentoring is typically an extension of tutoring. You must commit to tutoring for at least 6 months prior to becoming a mentor. If this is something you're interested in, please complete the required <a href="https://www.citygospelmission.org/become-mentor/" target="_blank">application</a> and return to 3500 Madison Rd. Cincinnati, OH 45209 (Attn. Whiz Kids). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmDw1k-sotE">Check out this video on mentoring from City Gospel Mission.</a></p>

<br><blockquote>Signing up for Whiz Kids six years ago was my plan B to make a difference in the life of a young person. God had a different idea though for a greater story, as He often does, and changed Whiz Kids to my plan A as Deshay, my student and now mentee, and I moved forward in our relationship. As we have walked our journey together, it has allowed both of us to become teachers and learners to each other. While it hasn't been without its challenges at times, it has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my life as I have watched us both grow emotionally, mentally and spiritually.</blockquote>
