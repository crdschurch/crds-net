<p class="lead">Coming together at Thanksgiving to help those in need in our communities is a chance for us to be obedient to who he calls us to be: A community that serves others. It’s about giving the poor and vulnerable in our communities a chance to build relationships around their own Thanksgiving table and reminding people they aren’t alone.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">Poverty is more than a lack of financial resources. It looks different for different people. It could be brief periods of hard times, chronic poverty, or too little income to meet daily expenses. And when people lack strong relationships or community, it’s even worse, putting children at even greater risk.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">Take a minute to consider Thanksgiving from their perspective. Talk to your community of family, friends, or small groups about financial, relational, and spiritual poverty.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">Here are three questions to get you started:</p>
<ol class="crds-list"><li>It's often said that a kitchen or dining room table is where real relationship happens. The centerpiece of most Thanksgiving celebrations is a large meal. Sitting at the table with family, sharing a bountiful Thanksgiving meal with family and friends is amazing. Share your best memory of Thanksgiving with the group. The biggest turkey in your group goes first.</li>
<li>Reflect on a time when you've been in need financially, relationally, or spiritually. Share the story with your group.</li>
<li>The difference between remaining in poverty and being vulnerable is often dependent on available resources. One of the main resources can be relationship and community. Have you or someone you've known ever been without resource of relationship and/or community? Yep, you guessed it, share with the group.</li>
