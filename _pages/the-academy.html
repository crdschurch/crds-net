<br><blockquote>I grew up without much but I have been blessed. So when I retired, I decided I wanted to work with these kids who have their own challenges. I didn't know I would be on the receiving end instead of the giving end. These kids bring me so much joy! It takes the kids a while before they decide they can trust you and they will test any boundary...but when I see them being proud of their work or standing a little taller because their confidence has increased, I stand a little taller too. When I see the kids being leaders and helping the other kids make better decisions, I know their lives have changed for the better and they are more likely to make a positive difference in the lives of others. This program changes lives and I'm pleased to be associated. It takes a village so they say. I want to be part of this village. I don't always look forward to coming to academy but I'm never sorry I came.</blockquote>
