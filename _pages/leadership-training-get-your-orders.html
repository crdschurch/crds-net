  <h3>Try it out</h3>
  <p>This one is huge, and with discipline, it can become part of your lifestyle. So this week, listen for God. If you think you hear something, no matter how big or small, find a friend and process with them. Observe it. Reflect on it. Discuss it with that friend. Make a plan with them, get some accountability in place, and then act.</p>
