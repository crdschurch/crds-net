        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Does Next BIG Thing cost anything?</strong><br> Nope. 100% free.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Should I come to a Crossroads site to participate?</strong><br> NO! All
          Crossroads buildings will be closed when we go live. All you need is a phone or computer to see the stream.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>So how do we participate?</strong><br> The stream will be on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHpWI1liDspGqKMFWGpFi1w"
            target="_blank">Crossroads Student Ministry YouTube page</a> 7:30pm on Sunday, October 21. Get on there and
          subscribe. Just click on the video, watch, and participate as much as you want to. We’d suggest getting a
          group together an hour before and hosting a little NBT party (with snacks, of course). That’ll be the best
          experience.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Do I have to sign up for anything?</strong><br> No, but if you want the best
          possible NBT experience (and maybe a better chance at winning something), consider getting in a group.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>How do I stream? By myself or with people?</strong><br> Do you have some
          friends you’d like to hang with Sunday, October 21? Then, they should be your group for NBT. Find out if one
          of your parents is cool with hosting. They can either stream from one device, or you can each stream using
          your own phone. You definitely want your phone nearby as there will be lots of ways to engage digitally.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Do I have to do anything during the stream?</strong><br> No, you don’t have
          to do anything. But you’ll have lots of opportunities to influence what happens in the stream. (HINT: You’ll
          probably want to.)</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Is this like BIG?</strong><br> We think it’s better because you don’t have to
          come to a building. In fact, if you do show up at a building, you’ll be really lonely, because all Crossroads
          buildings will be closed.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Can I stream if I’m not in 6-12th grade?</strong><br> Yes, you can. But only
          students in 6-12th grade are eligible for prizes and giveaways.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Can I win if I just watch and don’t participate?</strong><br> Two words: Un.
          Likely.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Where are you broadcasting from?</strong><br> From an undisclosed location 3
          miles underground. I’ve said too much already. You’ll watch on YouTube, so subscribe now.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>How do I keep updated on this thing?</strong><br> You’ll wanna <a href="https://www.instagram.com/crds_sm/?hl=en"

        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>If my student is under 13 years old, can they set up a YouTube account on
            their own to participate?</strong> </p>
        <div>NO! They will need you or someone over 13 to allow them to login and participate. <span>The Children's
