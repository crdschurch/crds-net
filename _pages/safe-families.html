<p class="lead">Why do we wait until bad things happen to children before we help? Child welfare systems are designed to react after something bad happens to a child. Such interventions are necessary and critically important in cases of abuse and neglect (see <a href="https://crossroads.net/fostercare">crossroads.net/fostercare</a>). But what if we stepped up before bad things happen, in situations where families are struggling and parents are in crisis?</p>
<p>Safe Families for Children is a ministry of hospitality and compassion where safe, loving families voluntarily host children overnight in their homes for short periods of time to be a blessing to the birth parents as they work to recover from various levels of crisis or dysfunction.</p>
<hr><p><strong>How to become a Safe Family:</strong><br> You will need to complete training, background checks, child abuse checks, reference checks, and a home assessment. The entire process can be done at your own pace, but can be completed within a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>How Safe Families works:</strong><br> An approved Safe Family creates a profile of the children they are equipped to host—things like age ranges, number of children, and gender. When a need to host children arises that fits your profile, you may be contacted to affirm or decline your current availability to host.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the families that need help from Safe Families?</strong><br> For families caught in various levels of crisis, they may need to have someone take care of their children for a few days, weeks, or months. This short-term hospitality helps the family step back from the brink of a disaster (circumstances that often lead to abuse or neglect), and gives the parents an opportunity to recover. Examples include medical emergencies or surgeries, homelessness, joblessness, incarceration, and substance abuse treatment.</p>

<br><br><blockquote>From a dad after his children were hosted: Hello Safe Families - I sincerely appreciate all the good you have done for my family. I can't thank you enough; I want to say that your presence, assistance, and love can't be underestimated. I pray that the good Lord will reward you all graciously. Please, kindly extend my heartfelt appreciations to Tammi, Kim, and Jason; appreciations also to your beautiful daughters. <br><span>Thanks! Ben</span></blockquote>
