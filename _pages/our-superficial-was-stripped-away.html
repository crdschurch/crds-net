<p class="font-size-base">I never realized how hiking a mile into camp, needing to plan ahead how we would sleep together and eat together, having to be prepared for the outdoor elements, and all that is involved with camping...would bring us together so quickly and strip away the superficial way we often interact. What an awesome experience! The individual work, the gorgeous feast, the music, the messages, the prayer tent, the campfire timeâ€¦it was all AWESOME!</p>
