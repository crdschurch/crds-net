            <p class="font-size-base push-half-top">Working at Crossroads means we run into the burning building, not
              away from it. We realize there is a battle, and souls are on the line. Our staff are guides. The
              thousands of volunteers who make up this place are the real heroes. We partner with them to chase after
              people from our neighborhoods to the ends of the earth. We work to introduce them to God in a way they
              understand.</p>

            <p class="font-size-base push-half-top">Being in ministry means sacrificing for others. We give our time,
              our resources, and our money. In fact, our staff contributes 8% to our overall budget. When you join
              staff at Crossroads, you agree to the biblical principle of at least a tithe (10% of your gross income)
              to fuel Crossroads.</p>

            <p class="font-size-base push-half-top">Jesus said anyone who wants to follow him has to pick up their
              cross and die every day. When we walk in the door, our personal agendas go out the window. We put a
              premium on obedience to God, because that’s how we show we love him (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A15&amp;version=NASB"
                target="_blank">John 14:15</a>). The prerequisite for chasing Jesus is trading all of our own ambition
              and goals for his.</p>

            <p class="font-size-base push-half-top">Working at Crossroads allows you to live as the church with our
              community. As 1 Corinthians 12:26 says, if one of us suffers, we all suffer. If one of us is celebrating,
              we all celebrate. That looks like delivering food when one of us is sick, exchanging prayer requests,
              babysitting, partying together—anything that looks like God’s idea of church.</p>

            <p class="font-size-base push-half-top">For real, we’re (appropriately?) irreverent. We still laugh at the
              same jokes we thought were funny in middle school. If you think fart jokes are immature, this definitely
              isn’t the place for you. If you don’t like smack talk—don’t join the March Madness office pool.</p>

            <p class="font-size-base push-half-top">Faith means living in ambiguity, because God doesn’t give us the
              whole picture all the time. If you want a roadmap, we don't have one. If you can't change at the drop of
              a dime, move on. We live off the daily bread God provides. If you’re hoping there are weeks and weeks of
              supplies, you will be disappointed. We don’t have a huge secret bank account somewhere, because we
              believe we are better to invest what God gives to us rather than horde it. We live in expectation that
              God will provide more tomorrow. And He’s been gracious to give us what we need.</p>
