<p></p>
<p><b>Will there be alcohol at this event?</b></p>
<p><span>Yes. While it is certainly not the focus, alcohol will be present.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How much is it?<br></b><span style="line-height: 1.625;">MAN CAMP is $59.99.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.625;"><strong>How old do I need to be to attend MAN CAMP?<br></strong></span>The minimum
    age for MAN CAMP is 18. We know there are lots of 15 year old men (and 40 year old boys), but the law of our state
    says you're an adult at 18 (and MAN CAMP is an adults only adventure).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="line-height: 1.425;">What if I’ve never camped before?<br></strong>No
    problem. This trip is all about getting outside your comfort zone, alongside other men. We’re here to challenge you
    and encourage you, whether you’ve camped for decades or don’t own a tent. When we trade convenience, comfort and
    security for the great unknown, we’re pretty much guaranteed to grow.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I don’t know anybody?<br></strong>Perfect! You’ll make friends in no
    time. Every man camper will be assigned a unit: a group of 9 other guys, led by a trip captain. You’ll do
    everything with your unit: get outfitted, bring food, set up camp, compete and generally solve problems. You are
    going to be good friends with your unit by the time this trip is over.</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>What if I don't go to Crossroads?<br></strong>Cool! You'll still love it. Tons of other guys who don't call
    Crossroads home will be there. MAN CAMP is powered by Crossroads but the movement is way bigger than that.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What do I need to bring?<br></strong>Once you’re signed up, we’ll send you a
    full list. But the short version is: one duffel bag and one backpack, filled with camping gear, a chair, dry
    clothes and food.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">How long is it?<br></strong><span>From </span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1861937284"
        tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">Friday</span></span><span> evening to around </span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1861937291"
        tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">1pm</span></span><span> </span><span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1861937292"
        tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">on Sunday</span></span><span> afternoon.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div><b>What time do I need to be there <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_2064217424" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">on
                Friday</span></span>?</b></div>
<div><span>Ingress will be available from 1600-1830. If you arrive early you'll be directed to a staging area until
        1600.  As long as you are inside the gate by 1830, you're good. </span><span>Your entire Unit must be present
        to begin the hike in.</span></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I have to leave early?<br></strong><span>You’re in for the whole deal if
        you go. The entire event is a communal experience.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if it rains?<br></strong>Then we’ll probably get wet.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if it snows?<br></strong>Snow is a lot like rain, but colder.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What are we doing?<br></strong>Sleeping outside. Building fires. Roasting pigs.
    Laughing. Competing. Splitting wood. Drinking malted beverages (if we’re old enough). BYOing pretty much
    everything. Testing our strength. Telling stories. Making pals. Talking to God. Doing life together.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">Why do tickets go on sale so early in the morning?<br></strong>See above re:
    getting outside your comfort zone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">Is this event tax-deductible?<br></strong>Sorry, no.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">Can I buy a block of tickets for my buddies?<br></strong>Nope. Each man needs to
    commit (because that’s what men do) to this and reserve their own spot. Plus, everybody has to sign the waiver
    electronically. Do you trust your buddy to sign your life away? (Just saying.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I sign up, and then cancel at the last minute?<br></strong>Tickets are
    non-refundable. If you cancel, we’ll give your spot to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if there’s an emergency at home while I’m gone?<br></strong>We’ll have a
    way for your family to reach you (and you them) if there’s an emergency. And by emergency we don’t mean the cable
    goes out or Buster wins his football game.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.625;">What if I can’t sleep without a CPAP?<br></strong>Can’t is a pretty strong
    statement. We know that is a reality for a few of us. We don’t have any electricity available and portable CPAP
    options are crazy expensive. We have had men <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B004EIAADG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_n5T-AbZQ0NERT">use
        this portable battery pack to power their units</a> and it has worked well for the entire weekend. They
    recommend turning off any extra features on your machine to conserve the battery. If you truly cannot sleep without
    a CPAP, and you can’t justify buying a battery pack, MAN CAMP probably isn’t a good choice for you.</p>
