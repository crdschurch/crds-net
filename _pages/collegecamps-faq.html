<hr><p class="flush-bottom font-size-base push-top"><strong>Who is this for?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Anyone from ages 18–23 (you don’t actually have to be enrolled a college, just be at that age).</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>How much is it?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">College Camp is $49.99. Trust us—it will be worth it.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if I’ve never camped before?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">No problem. This trip is all about getting outside your comfort zone, alongside other college students. We’re here to challenge you and encourage you, whether you’ve camped for decades or don’t own a tent. When we trade convenience, comfort and security for the great unknown, we’re pretty much guaranteed to grow.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if I don’t know anybody?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Perfect! You’ll make friends in no time. Every camper will be assigned a group: a group of 9 other college guys or girl students, led by a trip captain. You’ll do everything with your group: bring food, set up camp, compete and generally solve problems. You are going to be good friends with your group by the time this trip is over.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if I don't go to Crossroads?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Great! You’re in the right place. There will be hundreds from colleges across the region that don’t attend Crossroads.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What do I need to bring?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Once you’re signed up, we’ll send you a full list. But the short version is: one duffel bag and one backpack, filled with camping gear, a chair, dry clothes and food.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if I don't have a tent or gear?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Fear not! Once you get assigned to a campsite, you can work through that scenario. People can share, borrow, and figure out solutions. Can't pitch a tent? No worries. We're learning, too.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What is not fair game to bring?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Please do not bring drugs (yes, that includes the herbal essences), alcohol, firearms or your sex drive. Tobacco? Have at it.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>How long is it?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">A day and a half. One night. From Friday morning to around lunch time on Saturday.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base font-size-base"><strong>What time do I need to be there on Friday?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Gates will be open from 7am–8:30am. Plan to arrive then. If you miss it, tough luck. Your entire group must be present to begin the hike in.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if I have to leave early?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">You’re in for the whole 30 hours if you go. C’mon though, it’s just a day and a half.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if it rains?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Then we’ll probably get wet.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if it snows?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Snow is a lot like rain, but colder.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>Can I buy a block of tickets for my friends?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Nope. Each camper needs to commit to this and reserve their own spot. Plus, everybody has to sign the waiver electronically. Do you trust your friends to sign your life away?</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if I sign up, and then cancel at the last minute?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Tickets are non-refundable. Seriously. If you cancel, we’ll give your spot to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>What if there’s an emergency at home while I’m gone?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">If there’s an emergency, we’ll have a way for your family to reach you (and you to them).</p>
<p class="flush-bottom font-size-base"><strong>I train service dogs, can I bring mine?</strong></p>
<p class="font-size-base push-bottom">Unfortunately, you can't. Please don’t show up to camp with a dog, no matter how well-behaved he is. Please make arrangements for this in advance, or sign up for College Camp at a better time for your situation.</p>
