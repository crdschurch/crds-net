<p class="lead">Crossroads Preschool provides a safe, fun and welcoming environment where kids can grow and develop intellectually, physically, socially, and emotionally through cognitive experiences and hands on activity. Music, art and play are used to encourage creative expression. Staff is trained to use positive management techniques which encourages children to set internal limits on his/her own behavior.</p>
