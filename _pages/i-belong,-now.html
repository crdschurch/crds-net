<p class="lead">I was pretty nervous about Woman Camp. I’m an urban city girl and I knew this was way outside my element. But I felt a strong urgency to sign up.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">At the first pre-camp meeting, the ladies in the group were very encouraging, trying not to scare me too much as far as what to expect. I went and experienced a refreshing in my spirit, mind and emotions in way I’ve not experienced before. Even now, I still feel the strong change that has happened in me. A chance that happened with my Father God’s one simple statement “You belong to Me.” I didn’t realize until that day that this is what I needed to hear from my Heavenly Father to make me feel whole. Sexual abuse in my life left me fractured...but that weekend in the woods with my heavenly Dad brought a deep healing and freedom as well as rest and new friendships.</p>
