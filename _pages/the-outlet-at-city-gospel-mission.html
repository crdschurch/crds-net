      <p class="lead">Build relationships with the homeless in our city by hanging out at The Outlet at City Gospel
        Mission, a place where they can recharge and connect with people who care about them by providing positive
        interpersonal relationships. Whether it’s playing cards, shooting pool or just sharing stories, friendships are
        built and hope is transferred at The Outlet. And through the relationships established there, the homeless are
        then encouraged to enter into long-term recovery programs.</p>
      <p class="small">Volunteers are needed to build relationships with homeless men and women, as well as lead
        various activities, such as art, music and games. Volunteer once or as often as you want.</p>
      <p class="font-size-small"><strong>No need to sign up. Just come and join us!</strong></p>

      <blockquote>I began serving at the Outlet about 8 years ago with a bit of a mindset that I could help people
        improve their lives. Maybe I have somewhat, but the much bigger change has been within me. I've learned to look
        beyond outward appearances and see the person inside. Have made some good friends there and am a richer man for
        it. When you strip away the veneer of poverty, or skin color, or other things that blind the eyes, you often
        find a beautiful person hiding out.... needing a friend…<span>-Stephen</span></blockquote>
