<p>The world grinds us down and leaves us for dead. We feel pressure from all sides: our jobs, our girlfriends, our wives (hopefully one or the other), our kids...I’ll bet your buddy secretly feels like he’s bearing the weight of the world on his shoulders. <a href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/18/modern-life-rough-on-men/" target="_blank">And research shows that he’s less of a man than his dad</a>. Is the highlight of his week watching SportsCenter? Or just getting 10 blessed minutes alone in the crapper without someone asking him some asinine question? Does he live in fear? That sucks. Give your pal a whole weekend to just be a guy. To finally take a freaking break. On his own terms. To have some real, honest, manly FUN with no judgment.</p>

It’s loneliness. We suck at making friends. I mean REAL friends. Friends that we can get together with for no reason. That we make time for. That make time for us. Your buddy needs a pal. Maybe that looks like you inviting him to MAN CAMP.</p>

If you don’t think your buddy needs bourbon and a campfire...there’s a gap between us I can’t span.</p>

<h2 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase font-size-h1 text-center push-bottom" style="line-height: .9em;">2.<br>He has the potential<br> to change generations</h2>
<p>Men are made to lead. As we go, so goes our country. The more men we get involved in this movement of MAN CAMP, the more brothers, fathers, sons, uncles get involved. Those men will influence all of the people around them. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-gail-gross/the-important-role-of-dad_b_5489093.html" target="_blank">Families will look different</a>. Sons will have footsteps to follow. Daughters will have someone to look to as an example of what their future husband should be. That is IMPORTANT.</p>

<h2 class="font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase font-size-h1 text-center push-bottom" style="line-height: .9em;">1.<br>Because nobody else<br> is helping him</h2>
<p>Take a look at your news feed. Where’s the hope? The good news? A plan to escape all the BS of everyday life? IT’S NOT THERE. Life is a constant battle, and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140728-why-is-all-the-news-bad" target="_blank">culture isn’t helping one bit</a>. If you’ve found something valuable in MAN CAMP, you need to offer that same help to your friend. <br><br>Don’t say no for your buddy. Take the bold step and invite him. Shoot, maybe even buy his ticket. Sounds like something a good dude like you would do for his pal. Take away any excuse for him not to go. Give him what he really needs.</p>
<br><p>See you out there,<br>Judd</p>
