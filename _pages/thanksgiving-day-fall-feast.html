      <p class="lead">Fall Feast is a city-wide meal held each Thanksgiving Day at Duke Energy Center. Hundreds of
        volunteers prepare and serve Thanksgiving dinner to people who might not otherwise enjoy one, and guests
        receive gifts such as free coats, haircuts, vision screenings and flu shots.</p>
      <p class="font-size-small">Crossroads volunteers also serve meals at nursing homes, shelters and other care
        facilities across the city so that people who cannot attend the meal downtown or who would otherwise be alone
        will have community on Thanksgiving Day.</p>
      <p class="font-size-small">Since 2011, thousands upon thousands of people have been served, with loads of food
        and loads of love.</p>
      <p class="font-size-small">We’d love for you to join us! Ready?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Share A Meal and Clean-Up at Duke Energy Center</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span>Share a Meal is probably the most unique volunteer opportunity at Fall Feast. The best gift
          you can give is your time and fellowship over a meal. Simply breaking bread with someone in need can be so
          meaningful for you and them. These are the volunteers that join in the ballroom at the dinner table, get
          conversation going, and share life with our guests. You meet the most amazing, unique people at Fall Feast.
          This position calls for people that are talkers, love to share, and want to make this more than a dinner for
          guests.</span><span> Sign up individually, as a family, or small group.</span></p>

          facility, or another location with people who would love to share and experience Thanksgiving. Provide
