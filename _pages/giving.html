      <p class="lead">Giving away money—and making sacrifice a routine part of your life—is critical for growing
        spiritually, trusting God, and leaving your legacy on this world. It’s not about being “easy,” it’s about grit
        and commitment. Investing in something bigger than yourself. Believing in the power of loving your neighbor
        more than yourself, and being part of bringing His Kingdom to earth.</p>

                  2015 and continues strong amongst our community. Thousands of people got fired up— ready to invest in
                  serious life-change both here and abroad. They committed to give money above and beyond their normal
                  giving. It’s been bold, exciting, trust-inducing, and it’s not over. You can be “in,” too.</span>

          <p class="font-size-base">India is a major source, destination, and transit country for women and children
            subjected to sex trafficking. Crossroads supports Indian partners who provide housing, education, job
            readiness, social enterprise and community to rescued survivors of trafficking. We fight alongside the
            Indian Christian Church to fully eradicate this harrowing form of oppression.</p>

            CHANGE TO SOUTH AFRICA</h4>
          <p class="font-size-base">South Africa is a land of incredible potential, but it faces barriers of extreme
            poverty, the AIDS epidemic, and a heartbreaking lack of fathers and mothers for thousands of orphans and
            vulnerable children. Our partnership with Grace Bible Church and the groundbreaking Center of Hope (Soweto)
            is about generation-altering change by building into the promising culture of South African
            entrepreneurship.</p>

            OUR OWN CITIES</h4>
          <p class="font-size-base">The crystal-clear mission of Crossroads has always been to reach our friends and
            neighbors and share the message of Jesus. It’s why we started in a rented schoolroom and haven’t stopped
            expanding to make room for everyone we possibly can. This expansion looks like on-site weekend experiences,
            digital messaging and robust channels, and infrastructure to build community from the ground up.</p>

            POSSIBILITY TO THE WORKING POOR</h4>
          <p class="font-size-base">Holistic change for the working poor means getting in the trenches—and that’s
            exactly what it looks like at CityLink Center in Cincinnati. After years of research and partnerships,
            CityLink Center is the culmination of how it looks to put holistic services around the individual who’s
            stuck in the cycle of poverty, in a way that creates lasting life change and generational hope.</p>
