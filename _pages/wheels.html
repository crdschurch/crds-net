<p class="lead">Have you ever thought about trying to find a job, get to work, buy groceries or take the kids to the doctor without a car? In this day and age, it’s difficult, almost impossible, to live in Cincinnati without a vehicle. Wheels is a volunteer team dedicated to helping meet the transportation needs of people in our community. The team reconditions donated vehicles and passes them on to qualified recipients. Email us at <a href="mailto:wheels@crossroads.net">wheels@crossroads.net</a>.</p>
<p class="push-top"><strong>Donate</strong><br> Do you have a used car that’s in decent condition that you’re thinking or trading or selling? Consider giving it to the Wheels ministry instead. You can get a tax deduction for the fair market value. And more importantly, you’ll get the satisfaction of knowing that you've been a huge blessing to someone in need. Email us at <a href="mailto:wheels@crossroads.net">wheels@crossroads.net</a></p>
<p class="push-top"><strong>Volunteer Service Team</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re an ASE Certified Technician, a backyard mechanic that loves to tinker, or someone that likes to make a car shine, there’s a place for you at Wheels. Volunteers are needed to inspect, service and make minor repairs on donated vehicles. Service work is done at the Crossroads Annex in Oakley. Email your questions to <a href="mailto:wheels@crossroads.net">wheels@crossroads.net</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Over the past year I have been trying to get a certain position at work. I was passed over the past 2 times it's been posted. I got the position this time and was told the only reason I didn't get it before was because of my car breaking down all the time. I got it this time because I have a more reliable car. Thank you for the car which allowed me to get the opening I very much needed.</blockquote>
