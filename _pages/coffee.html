<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">Why even have coffee?</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">Coffee has been an important part of the Crossroads culture since day one. Maybe it’s because we’re called to a huge vision from God and we need all the help (caffeine) we can get to run after it. Or, more likely, it’s because handing someone a free, hot, delicious cup of coffee is the non-creepy equivalent of giving a full body hug and whispering “I love you” in their ear. In other words, it’s a surprisingly simple way to share some love and communicate value to every single person who walks in the door.</p>

</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-6">
<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">Why not charge a couple of bucks or put out a mason jar with “donations” taped to it?</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">When you invite a friend over to your house, do you offer them coffee? <br><span class="push-left">Um, yes.</span> <br>Do you charge them for it? <br><span class="push-left">Duh, no.</span> <br>We feel the same way.</p>
<p class="font-size-base push-ends">We don’t want the first interaction a person has with Crossroads to be a transaction. Crossroads is relational above transactional every day of the week. BTW, so is God. We’re just following his lead. So all of our coffee is free and we pay for it out of the generosity of our people.</p>
<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">I assume we’re using the cheapest coffee beans possible so all the money we save can go directly to people in need, right?</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">You know what happens when you assume? You make an ass out of Uma Thurman. Never do that.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">You’d be surprised by how <em>not</em> cheap our coffee is. But, you’ll also be shocked by how much good it does in the world. Let’s talk about Luis Alberto Balladarez Moncada. We call him Luis (mostly because we can’t pronounce the rest of his name), and he owns the farm in Nicaragua from where we directly source our coffee.</p>

<div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-3 push-half-top"><img data-src="//crds-cms-uploads.imgix.net/content/images/crossroads-coffee-story2.jpg" alt="people and coffee at crossroads" class="img-full-width imgix-fluid" title=""></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-6">
<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">OK, tell me about Luis.<br>What is the story on his coffee?</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">Luis and his family own a successful coffee business in Nicaragua where they produce “speciality” coffee. <a href="http://www.royalcupcoffee.com/blog/articles/what-speciality-coffee" target="_blank">Pro tip: “Speciality” in the coffee world means “best of the best.”</a> It’s like the Lebron James of beans.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">But wait, there’s more. Third world industries like chocolate or coffee don’t have a sparkling reputation for high wages or great working conditions. But Luis loves Jesus. And relying on faith, he’s decided to run his business differently, with a focus on above average wages and commitment to his workers and their families. Oh, and his facility? Also way above average. We don’t have time to go into the details, but <a href="http://www.atlascoffee.com/coffees/finca-un-regalo-de-dios/" target="_blank">read this if you want to know more</a>. Luis wants his farm, employees, and community to thrive. That’s unique in the industry.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">We’re gushing now, but get this. Recently, Luis took his business profits and bought a bunch of mountain-ready motorcycles and gave them to local pastors who live in the mountains. These bikes allow the pastors to get to places a car could never reach, helping them meet the needs of people all over the region. Man, we love Luis.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">Oh, and if we talk about Luis like we know him, that’s because we do. Having a relationship with the actual farm owner who grows your coffee is unheard of in the church world. At least, we’d never heard of it. Neither had Luis. But our team has visited Luis and his farm many times over the past couple of years, and Luis has visited us in the U.S. We’ve seen the beans, hugged the workers, and shared some laughs (pro traveler tip: fart noises are funny in any language.)</p>

<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">You’ve mentioned Nicaragua, doesn’t Crossroads do stuff there?</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">Yep. That’s another reason why we invest in the work Luis is doing. Crossroads loves the people of Nicaragua. We’ve developed a huge partnership with <a href="https://www.compassion.com/" target="_blank">Compassion International</a> and we do <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/reachout/go/nicaragua/" target="_blank">GO Trips</a> with groups like <a href="http://amigosforchrist.org/" target="_blank">Amigos for Christ</a>.

<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">What about roasting?<br>Do we use some super-mega-huge-impersonal corporate coffee roasting conglomerate?</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">Actually, exactly the opposite. This story just keeps getting better. Check this action out: Crossroads’ coffee is roasted by a delightful couple from Northern Kentucky, <a href="https://www.carabellocoffee.com/" target="_blank">Justin and Emily Carabello</a>. You should totally watch their story <a href="https://vimeo.com/106376920" target="_blank">here</a>. Long story short, they also love Jesus and feel called to <a href="https://www.carabellocoffee.com/pages/giving-back" target="_blank">support sustainable farming and business in Nicaragua</a>. They roast delicious coffee and take their earnings and do incredible good in the world. We’ll drink to that!</p>

<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">Wow. I mean, wow.</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">We know, right? Here’s the thing. The coffee at Crossroads, which we’re sure you’ve personally never, for one second, taken for granted, is changing the world. It’s roasted by a small business founded on philanthropy and directly bought from a farmer we personally know who is committed to running his business in a way that honors God. Imagine a bunch of celebratory emojis right here followed by a coffee cup and some fireworks!</p>
<p class="font-size-base">Know this: Just by drinking a cup of Crossroads coffee, you are supporting this work. Well done.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">But even better, if you give money to Crossroads, YOU are directly involved in not only blessing a friend or neighbor with a cup of delicious hot joe, you’re changing lives in Nicaragua. Triple well done.</p>

<h2 class="font-family-base font-size-h5">I’m inspired. What can I do?</h2>
<p class="font-size-base">This ridiculous experiment in Kingdom economics only happens because of average, everyday people sharing their resources. Crossroads isn’t backed by some huge corporation. The coffee you drink each weekend isn’t donated by some generous millionaire. We buy it. (35,000 pounds of it per year, to be exact.) And then we give it to our friends.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">If that’s something you appreciate—if actively being part of the solution to poverty in our world even remotely pokes at your heart, then <a href="https://www.crossroads.net/give/">consider giving to Crossroads</a>. After that, add ‘world-changer’ to your list of accomplishments. And sip Luis’ sweet, succulent coffee goodness to your heart’s content.</p>
