<p class="lead">Two words: LIFE CHANGING. Although I could say 1,000 words more, I will chose those. I am a mother of 5 who was stuck in the everyday rut of life.</p>
<p class="font-size-base">School drop offs, pickups, homework, sports every night of the week, work, keeping up the house. Nothing to better myself. Woman Camp was the best thing I could have done not only for myself, but for my family as well. See, I had just been skating through life, same routine another day. I grew up believing in God and the Kingdom of Heaven, but I had never "felt" God or "connected" with him, either. Saturday night while we were singing, I surrendered my life to Jesus. Sunday morning I slowly walked over to the Prayer Tent...something magical happened in there. I released stuff inside of me that I never knew was in there. I felt healed, renewed, a new woman!</p>
<p class="font-size-base">The weeks since we've been home, I have felt God, heard him, and most importantly finally have the peace within me that I've been so desperately seeking my entire life. I wake up and soak in the dew. My life has made a beautiful transformation, and I thank Jesus and the powerful women behind Woman Camp for this new start to life.</p>
