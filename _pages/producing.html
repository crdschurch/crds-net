                      <p class="font-size-small bg-gray soft">Quick Tips:<br><em>Producers aren’t “done.” They haven’t
                          arrived. They’re still seeking, receiving, and following like the rest of us. They’ve just
                          had more practice, and they’re quicker to be humble. Encourage them wildly. We need them.
                          Connect them to people to lead if they have capacity. Help them connect to people who can
                          help them refill. Refresh them with encouragement, community, vision, and celebrations of the
                          breakthroughs being made in the spiritual realm because of their faithfulness.</em></p>

                        <li>They’re not perfect, but they have loads of experience seeking, receiving, and following.
                          They’re quick to notice when something isn’t right in them, and they seek, receive, and
                          follow their way through to the other side.</li>
                        <li>They’re familiar with suffering. God has trained them and given them perspective and trust
                          in the midst of chaos, pain, or struggle. It’s rooted them, and they’re learning to walk
                          others through the same.</li>
                        <li>They’re in touch with their gifts and limitations, and they’re learning to call it out in
                          others.</li>
                        <li>They’re talking to God all throughout the day and hearing from him too. They’re wondering
                          how to pray without ceasing.</li>
                        <li>They show the fruit of the Spirit more naturally, but they still have their weak moments.
                          They crave environments and people who can challenge, encourage, and lead them.</li>
                        <li>They’re growing in humility, worship, discernment, and intercession.</li>
                        <li>They believe in supernatural healing. They pray for it often, and are starting to see it
                          happen.</li>
                        <li>They’re confident and practiced in walking others through repentance, forgiveness and
                          healing. They know their authority and the enemy knows they’re one to watch.</li>

                          abiding in the love they already feel, not striving for approval or fame from anyone else.</li>
                        <li>Figuring out where and how to share what God has done with them. What platforms,

                          are content with who they are. Image or stress isn’t on their mind very often.</li>
