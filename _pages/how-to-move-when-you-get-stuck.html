        <h4 class="font-family-base-bold font-size-base">SEEKING</h4>
        <p class="font-size-base">Whenever we’re new to faith or a season of life, whenever we have a question,
          whenever we’re stuck, whenever we experience crisis: we seek. Whether we believe in God yet or not or we’ve
          been following for years, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print"
            target="_blank">Jesus promises to answer</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3 push-bottom">
        <h4 class="font-family-base-bold font-size-base">RECEIVING</h4>
        <p class="font-size-base">When we are presented with an answer, we have a choice. We can either accept it or
          reject it. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print"
            target="" _blank="">We can receive, or not</a>. To receive means to take God at his word, believe him, <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+1%3A12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print" target="_blank">embrace
            it fully</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3 push-bottom">
        <h4 class="font-family-base-bold font-size-base">FOLLOWING<a href="javascript:scroll(&#039;following&#039;);"
            style="color: #0095d9;">*</a></h4>
        <p class="font-size-base">Once we really believe, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print"
            target="_blank">it leads to action</a>. True belief naturally takes shape in lifestyle. To follow means to
          stop negotiating with God, and to trust him enough to do what he says—regardless of how we feel, how
          difficult it seems, or how countercultural it might be. Because we trust he has our best in mind as a good
          Father, and because He’s King.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3 push-bottom">
        <h4 class="font-family-base-bold font-size-base">PRODUCING</h4>
        <p class="font-size-base">Anyone in the producing phase still has loads to learn, but they're a fantastic
          seeker, receiver, and follower. When they have a question or hit crisis, they go seek the Bible or sit before
          God in prayer to listen for direction. Then they receive it, they follow it, and fruit naturally follows.
          They don’t generate it with lots of work and effort. It flows from the process. Like a tree digging its roots
          deeper into the soil in search of more water, its fruit naturally grows from a place of abiding. <br><br></p>

        <h4 class="font-size-h2 font-family-condensed-extra text-uppercase">*The catch on following:</h4>
        <p class="lead">If we start obeying before we’ve really received, we fall into a terrible trap called religion
          — any system of rules that promises what only relationship can offer. If God wanted us to obey out of
          obligation, he would have made robots (that would have been a lot simpler). He wants us to follow him because
          we love him and trust Him. Trust doesn’t spring up overnight. So receiving God fully is a critical foundation
          for following.</p>

        <p class="font-size-base"><strong>Ever known someone who thought by obeying all the rules things would work out
            for them?</strong> Then something tragic happened, and it rocked them? They thought there was a system. And
          it didn’t pay off, so then all the obeying seemed like a ripoff.</p>

          didn’t know how to just be with God (which is what he wants far more anyway).</p>

        <p class="font-size-small"><strong>If we really trust Him as a good King</strong>, we default our rights and
          opinions to his, because we realize it’s his right to lead us.</p>
        <p class="font-size-small"><strong>So if we’re struggling to trust, we go back to the beginning</strong>. We
          seek. We ask him to show up. We ask him to remind us who He is and who we are.</p>
        <p class="font-size-small"><strong>Then we receive</strong>. We fully take it in. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians+10:5&amp;version=NIV"
