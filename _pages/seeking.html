                        meaning, but haven’t found it yet.</p>
                      <p class="lead">If you’re helping a seeker, you have an incredible opportunity to show them the
                        love of Jesus, not just point to a Bible verse —not always helpful. There's a whole <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/crds-cms-uploads/content/documents/How-To-Help-A-Seeker.pdf"><em>How
                            To Help a Seeker </em>guide</a> that goes more in-depth.</p>
                      <p class="font-size-small bg-gray soft">Quick Tips:<br><em>Don’t expect a seeker to act like a
                          believer. Drop assumptions. Meet them where they are. Don’t expect them to be somewhere
                          they’re not. If someone isn’t sure about truth yet, don’t just keep hitting them with it.
                          Debating rarely helps. Listen. Show them they’re loved. Show them another way. <br><br>
                          Ultimately, introduce them to the God who made them, who desires good things for them. Who
                          offers love, grace, kindness. Don’t shy away from truth, but reveal it in context. Through
                          words and action. Out of the overflow of the heart of a God who’s fiercely for their good.
                          Believe for them. Intercede for them. Love well.</em></p>
