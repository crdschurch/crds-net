<p class="lead">No fancy skills needed. You don’t have to be a teacher or a technology genius to help change the lives of our students in India and Nepal. Join us in helping students on the other side of the globe increase their opportunities and secure their futures of freedom by improving their English skills. The eWhiz International Tutoring (eWIT) program connects online tutors in Cincinnati with students in India/Nepal who are trafficking survivors or at-risk children, and prepares them for secondary education and gainful employment. eWIT volunteers have the opportunity to travel to India/Nepal on a team trip to meet their student each year.</p>

<p class="font-family-base font-size-small"><strong>Tutor (Oakley)</strong>:<br>Tutors commit to an 8-week session of weekly lessons. They tutor young women, children and adults from our partnering organizations, building relationships with their students and helping them progress in their English language skills. Lessons last around one hour one morning a week for 8 weeks. Weekday tutors arrive at 6:30am, and Saturday tutors arrive later on shifts.</p>
<p class="font-family-base font-size-small"><strong>Tech (Oakley)</strong>:<br>Tech volunteers also commit to an 8-week session of weekly lessons. They help to set up the computers, headsets and equipment for the tutors so that their lessons can run smoothly. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a technology genius to help! Tech volunteers set up before the lessons and help to tear down after they are over, totaling around 1.5 hours one morning a week for 8 weeks. Weekday techs arrive at 6:15am, and Saturday techs arrive later.</p>
<p class="font-family-base font-size-small"><strong>Curriculum Writer (Cincinnati, OH)</strong>:<br>Curriculum writers meet about once a month as a team and work independently and in small groups, allowing volunteers to be as committed as their schedule allows. Writers help to prepare lesson plans, assess students’ proficiency and provide curriculum training to volunteers.</p>
