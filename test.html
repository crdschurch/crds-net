          <p><strong>I got a gift tag magnet. Why doesn’t mine have a child’s name on it?</strong><br>
            Due to special requests for anonymity, there are some children receiving gifts whose names are not put on a
            tag. If your magnet has no name, it still represents a child in need of gifts and prayer!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Do I have to use Amazon?</strong><br>Yes, we encourage you to shop for gifts using Amazon. This
            year, gifts will be shipped to Christmas Wonderland to accommodate for limited storage at our sites.
          </p>
        </li>


        <li>
          <p><strong>What is the last day to purchase gifts?</strong><br> The last date to purchase gifts is December 8,
            2023.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Gifts wrapped or unwrapped?</strong><br>
            Unwrapped, please. If it comes nicely gift-wrapped, we will have to unwrap it. This enables parents to see
            the
            gift options as they shop for their kid(s). We will make it all pretty at the very end, even letting the
            guardian(s) choose to wrap the gift if they’d like.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>How many gifts should I buy for the child I selected?</strong><br>Please purchase 2 gifts per
            child.
            Each guardian that shops for their kid(s) will be getting 2 gifts per kid. If you wish to purchase
            additional
            gifts for other children, you can shop for additional items from the same Amazon list. Please remember 2
            gifts
            per child. Thank you for your generosity!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Do I need to pick up or drop gifts off? </strong><br>You don’t need to do either. All purchasing is
            done online to ensure these gifts will exactly fit the stated needs of the specific children we are serving.
            But you can volunteer in person to help us with sorting and processing at our warehouse!</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>How do I know how much a gift will cost?</strong><br>All gifts will range from $10-$30. If you shop
            in a store you will be able to see the price tag on the item or shelf so please feel free to do that! If you
            choose to shop on Amazon you will also be able to see the price of the item on the right side of the gift
            like
            so:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Can I deliver my gift straight to the family?</strong><br>No, we partner with organizations that
            support families in a way that offers parents the opportunity to shop for a gift for their child. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Are the Christmas shops happening at Crossroads sites?</strong><br>East Side, Mason, and Florence
            will host Christmas shops onsite. All other sites will host Christmas shops at our partner organizations.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>I bought a gift for the prison ministry. Can I drop it off at a site?</strong><br>No, we encourage
            you to shop for gifts using Amazon. This year, gifts will be shipped to Christmas Wonderland. From there,
            they
            will be sorted and shipped directly to our prison ministry locations.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>What if I know someone who could use help getting gifts for their kid(s)?</strong><br><em>You are
              the
              church! If you know someone in need, follow the steps below to care for your neighbor. You can do it!</em>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Start by having a conversation, don’t assume their needs. Afterall, CGD is more than a box.</em>
            </li>
            <li><em>If they want to provide gifts for their family then you cold give them cash, a gift card, or take
                them
                shopping. If the need is a warm home cooked meal, extra time, on their hands, and/or community this can
                all be solved by inviting them over to your Christmas dinner. (Jesus tip: you don’t have to know someone
                to invite them to your table “I was a stranger and you invited me in.” Matthew 25:35)</em></li>
            <li><em>Whatever you do, be sure to encourage them. Affirm the significance of their relationship to you.
                Affirm what is Godly that you see in them. And affirm them in the hope of Jesus Christ.</em></li>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Can I ship my gift(s) directly from Amazon to my Crossroads site?</strong><br>No, we encourage you
            to shop for gifts using the Wishlist address. This enables gifts to be shipped to Christmas Wonderland to
            accommodate for limited storage at our sites.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Amazon shows that my gift(s) are arriving after normal business hours. Will the gifts be
              okay?</strong><br>Yes! This year gifts will be delivered to Christmas Wonderland, which will have
            accommodations for after-hour deliveries.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Can you see when gifts are delivered?</strong><br>Yes! Amazon allows you to “spoil your surprise.”
            We opted for this so that we can actively monitor the gift lists and deliveries.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>What if my gift(s) shows up late?</strong><br>We are monitoring the lists to ensure that an item's
            delivery time will in fact arrive on time. However, if something unexpected happens and the gift arrives
            after Christmas Gift Drive events the gift will still be donated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Amazon is telling me I need to add delivery times for the site I’m shopping for. What should I
              do?</strong><br>Amazon offers various delivery times. Rest assured that your gifts will arrive safely
            24/7. We have accommodations for after-hour deliveries. And for Saturday and Sunday deliveries.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Amazon didn’t add a photo to their delivery. How can I know it was delivered?</strong><br>That’s
            alright, sometimes they don’t add photos! Sites can view deliveries and are monitoring them. We’re counting
            what is purchased and what comes in through mail to assure that your gift makes it to a child.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>My gift returned undeliverable. What now?</strong><br>We are so sorry! Amazon will automatically
            refund your card/payment method. You are welcome to purchase a gift from Amazon, or a local store, and drop
            it off in person at your site by 12/11 (unless you’re in Georgetown then 12/8 please). Thank you for your
            generosity!</p>

            prison.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>I signed up. What now?</strong><br>Look for an email within 48 hours for you to receive the
            required forms to fill out. Upon receipt of your forms, your location will be reviewed and forwarded to the

          <p><strong>May I volunteer at more than one location?</strong><br>Yes. You will indicate at sign-up which
            location(s) you would like to serve upon signing up and the Four-Seven will ensure your paperwork is
            distributed accordingly. However, due to arrival and start times, please anticipate volunteering at ONE
            location per day. You are welcome to sign up and stay for two same-day Christmas Miracle events at the same
            location, if offered. You will be able to determine if this is offered on the signup form.

        <li>
          <p><strong>I heard there is paperwork to volunteer in the prisons…Where do I find it and how do I submit

              complete
