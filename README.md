## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/crdschurch/crds-net.git` then `cd ./crds-net`
2. Make sure you have Ruby installed - check the [OS specific install instructions](#os-specific-instructions) 
3. If you don't have Bundler/Jekyll, install it: `gem install bundler jekyll`
4. Run `bundle install && npm i` to add dependencies
5. Make sure submodules are initialized and updated: `git submodule init && git submodule update`
6. Make sure you have [Contentful environment variables set](#working-with-content) and then run `bundle exec jekyll contentful` to get the site's content
7. Now you are ready to start a local dev server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`. If you are using Windows, you may need to refer to the [advanced instructions](#windows)

Alternatively, you can serve crds-net locally with Docker. Setup instructions [here](/docker/development/README.md).

## Working With Content
First, you need to export the following environment variables (you can get these values directly from Contentful or from Netlify)...
```bash
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
CONTENTFUL_ENV=
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_OAUTH_BASE_URL=
```
Then run the following command in your bash prompt to download content to your local `collections` directory:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll contentful
```
<strong>Protip:</strong> you can limit the amount of content coming back from the CMS to 10 entries per collection like this: `bundle exec jekyll contentful --limit 10`. More documentation on `jekyll-contentful` [here](https://github.com/crdschurch/jekyll-contentful).

### Images
With the help of imgix, we are using two strategies to increase performance while rendering images:

- Pixellated placeholders
- `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
  For more info on how this works, see the extended documentation in the [media repo](https://github.com/crdschurch/crds-media/blob/development/README.md#images).

#### Examples
**Inline Images**
```html
<img
  src="{{ page.image | imgix: site.imgix }}?{{ site.imgix_params.placeholder }}"
  sizes="{{ site.image_sizes.full_width }}"
  data-optimize-img
/>
```
This would translate to something like the following (before processing):
```html
<img
  src="//crds-media-int.imgix.net/5G62zla1zOsmKqSo8wmomI/d46b0ec8a96339c72f25b56b7c2dd99b/isle-of-skye.jpg?auto=format,compress&w=10"
  sizes="100vw"
  data-optimize-img
/>
```
**Background Images**
Background images work similarly, with three exceptions:

- A `data-optimize-bg-img` attribute is required for processing.
- The dimensions of the imgix image are set automatically based on the container (i.e. it assumes a _cover_ background approach).
- The script watches for changes to the size of the window and will update the background image appropriately.

### Meta Data
There will be times when you might want to provide custom meta data for page that lives in the repo (think /oakley). Simple add this block to your front matter above the last `---`:
```yaml
meta:
  title: My Amazing Page
  description: You won't believe how amazing this page is.
  image:
    url: "https://amazing-photos.net/cool"
```
<strong>Protip:</strong> indentation matters in `yaml`.  Watchout for code formatting that may remove spaces and jack up your frontmatter.

## Submodules
We’re using submodules to share code across multiple repos. You can think of a submodule as a repository within a repository. 

### Setup
When you first clone a repository with submodules, you’ll need to initialize and the pull in the latest changes. Like so:

```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:crdschurch/crds-net.git
    Cloning into 'crds-net'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 71, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (71/71), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (63/63), done.
    remote: Total 6544 (delta 27), reused 32 (delta 8), pack-reused 6473
    Receiving objects: 100% (6544/6544), 4.07 MiB | 7.93 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (3877/3877), done
    $ cd crds-net
    $ git submodule init
    Submodule '_pages' (git@github.com:crdschurch/crds-net-shared.git) registered for path '_pages'
    $ git submodule update
    Cloning into '/Users/tcmacdonald/Sites/tmp/crds-net/_pages'...
    Submodule path '_pages': checked out '995bfc915e66962451107f29d69ad8e4d19fe840'
```

### Troubleshooting
If you see a permissions error when trying to push the submodule, it'll look something like this:

```bash
remote: Permission to crdschurch/crds-net-shared.git denied to [USERNAME].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/crdschurch/crds-net-shared.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

It's likely that where you see `[USERNAME]` does not match your GitHub username. If on a Mac, this means OS X Keychain has stored a value for your GitHub username and password that is being used wherever you use HTTPS (rather than SSH) to push and pull code from GitHub.

To remedy this, you first have to delete the stored value:

```bash
$ git credential-osxkeychain erase
  host=github.com
  protocol=https
  <press return>
```

This behavior is odd. After hitting `Enter` after the first line, nothing happens -- you are directed to a blank line in the terminal. That's where you type in `host=github.com` and hit `Enter` again. Then followed by the next line. The third empty line you leave blank and hit `Enter` for a fourth time. Then your credentials should be stored.

If you try to push again, you should be prompted for a new username and password and those will be stored in your keychain for future use.

## Future Dated content
The file name is what keeps future dated content from showing on non layout pages. There are examples of this in the config.yml.

```yaml
collections:
  articles:
    filename: "{{ published_at | date: '%Y-%m-%d' }}-{{ slug }}"
```

## Build Logs

Build logs are dependant on two environment variables
- APPLICATION_NAME
- LOGZIO_API_KEY

To find an erroneous log use the following search term in the logz.io search bar:

    type:"APPLICATION_NAME"

APPLICATION_NAME is the value set to that environment variable

Build logs output to `buildlogs.txt`

* **Local development:**  
  Log is located at `_site/buildlogs.txt`

* **Netlify Build**  
  The log can be found at `[DEPLOY_URL]/buildlog.txt` on any deploy preview
  * Example: __https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.netlify.com/buildlog.txt__

## Advanced Setup
### Building Assets
`crds-net` uses `jekyll-asset-pipeline` to create Javascript/CSS assets. If you see that assets are not showing up make sure to check that [the pipeline is installed correctly](https://github.com/crdschurch/jekyll-asset-pipeline). If all else fails, try `rm -rf _site` and then start Jekyll back up.

### OS Specific Instructions
#### Mac
To get started with this project, first make sure you have Ruby installed. This
project requires the use of Ruby version >= 2.5.1. If you are on a Mac, Ruby should
already be installed but you may need to upgrade your version. rbenv is a great tool
to manage your Ruby versions. You can read about that [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation).
Once you have Ruby version >= 2.5.1 installed, make sure you have Ruby bundler
installed.
`gem install bundler`
After installing bundler, you will be able to install the project's dependencies that
are defined in the `Gemfile`. You can do that by running
`bundle install`
Once the project dependencies are installed, you can now kick off a build of the
project:
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
This will build the site and start up a preview server that allows you to view the
work that you have done.

####  Windows
##### Installing Ruby & Deps
First, make sure you have Ruby v2.5.1 installed on your machine. You can find Windows installers (with devkit) [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
Once you have Ruby version v2.5.1 installed, use Powershell or CMD Prompt to install the Ruby bundler by running
`gem install bundler`

After installing bundler, navigate to this project and install the project's dependencies that are defined in the `Gemfile`. You can do that by running `bundle install`

##### Serving the site
1. Initial site build: `bundle exec jekyll build`
2. Find the asset hash value in the `/temp/.asset_hash` file and assign it to the 'ASSET_HASH' environment variable.
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --skip-initial-build`

_Some background_: `bundle exec jekyll serve` serves the page but errors when loading anything from the `/assets` folder. This workaround makes it accessible.

####  Linux
First, make sure you have Ruby v2.5.1 installed on your machine. There is a proven guide
for getting Ruby installed on your machine that you can read
[here](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/16.04). This particular
guide only needs to be followed up until the `Configuring Git` heading. Everything
from `Configuring Git` onward is unnecessary to follow.
Once you have Ruby v.2.5.1 installed on your machine, you are ready to build the project:
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
This will build the site and start up a preview server that allows you to view the
work that you have done.

## Testing

## Contributing To The Repo
As with most crdschurch repos, local feature development should be done against the `development` branch. Follow these simple steps to contribute:

1. `git checkout development` and make sure that you are up to date (run `git pull`)
2. Checkout a fresh branch based off of development: `git checkout -b feature/my-branch-name`
3. Make local code changes and commit to your new branch
4. When the time is right, create a pull request comparing your new branch to development
5. After a review, your work will be merged into `development`
   After these first 5 steps, there are 2 deployment possibilities: Standard or Expedited. See below and choose the right choice for your work.

- Standard: Wait until the normal production deploy which takes place every 2 weeks on Wednesday afternoon. This is the best choice and should be used unless the work is extremely time sensitive.
- Expedited: Sometimes things just need to go to `prod` immediately. If this is the case follow the steps listed [in this doc](https://slack-files.com/T02C3F91X-FD2HHNMT7-c6400a04c1) or reachout to a Bearsharks team member.
